*DESCRIPTION*: In Task 2 of the SQL internship, I used MySQL to analyze customer purchases and sales data. The goal was to find useful insights, such as which customers buy the most, who spends the most money, and how sales change over time. To do this, I used three important SQL techniques: Window Functions, Subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

First, I used a Window Function to calculate the running total of sales for each customer. This means that instead of just seeing individual purchases, I could see how much a customer had spent over time. This helped me understand which customers were increasing their spending.

Next, I used a Subquery to find frequent customersâ€”those who placed more than five orders. The subquery first counted how many orders each customer made, and then I filtered the results to show only those who had made more than five purchases. This helped identify customers who buy often, so businesses can reward them with discounts or loyalty programs.
